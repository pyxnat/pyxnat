About
=====

:mod:`pyxnat` was originally developed at `CEA/Neurospin
<http://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/Pages/Entites_de_recherche/NeuroSpin.aspx>`_ and funded by the European project
`IMAGEN <http://imagen-europe.com/>`_. The project was started in 2009 with
Yannick Schwartz as the main developer but has since benefited from the
help of a lot of people. We would like to give special thanks to the XNAT
team at the Washington University of St Louis, and to the people at
Neurospin.
